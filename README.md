## Project Overview 
In this project, we will create an app that will take in the user’s name and if they want any topping on their coffee. There is a counter at the bottom for how many coffees the user wants. One the user presses order then the app will take that information and instantiate in to the user’s mail app, ready to send off the order.

In this project we will cover the following topics:
- **Check Views**
